# Hidden Div Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript where a div element is hidden using JavaScript but never made visible again. The solution shows how to fix this oversight.

## Bug
The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML page with a div and a button.  Clicking the button hides the div, but there's no code to show it again. This is an uncommon but easy-to-miss error.

## Solution
The `solution.html` file provides a corrected version.  It includes code to toggle the visibility of the div, ensuring it can be shown again.
